/**
 * BestFitSelection is a bin packing algorithm.
 *
 * In a general form, a heuristic algorithm can be represented as
 * A(N, R, M, S, W, P)
 *
 * N is the number of items
 * R is the number of items that need to be packed when refill the queue,  1 <= R <= N
 * M is the number of bins
 * S is the number of bins that need to be shipped when no item can fit into current bins
 * W is the preprocessing (sorting) algorithm
 * P is the packing rule
 *
 *
 * So, the Best fit algorithm can be represented in a general form as
 * A(1, 1, n, n, W0, PG) which means
 *
 * The waiting queue for container equals one.
 * This means, as soon as one container arrives. This container will be allocated at once.
 * There is n number of VM exists and to be considered.
 *
 *
 * W0 represents that the item will be First-come-First-serve.
 * No sorting preprocess on the items.
 * PG means packing rule is global:
 *
 * The global means, we will try to allocate the container into every VM and then
 * calculate their fitness value.
 * Then, we will return the VM who got the highest fitness value.
 *
 *
 * Algorithm Description:
 * 1. Use a fitness function to evaluate all VM
 * 2. Return the VM who has the highest fitness value
 *
 *
 * The difference between FF and BF is that, in FF,
 * once we find a VM has enough resource, we break from examing all the VMs.
 *
 * In BF, we need to go through all the VMs and assign them fitness values.
 * Then, we return the VM has the highest fitness value.
 *
 *
 *
 * Notice that, this implementation returns the VM ID instead of the VM itself.
 * Also, this algorithm only select the VM ID.
 * The algorithm does not allocate container to the selected VM.
 * We leave the allocation functionality to DataCenter
 *
 * If there is no capable VM, return 0 which means no suitable VM exists.
 *
